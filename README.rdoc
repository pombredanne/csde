= Cloud System Deployment and Experiment (CSDE) Tool

= DESCRIPTION

Cloud System Deployment and Experiment (CSDE), which is currently developed by AIFB (KIT) and FZI, is a web based tool to help you do following tasks

* rapidly deploy and easily manage distributed database systems in your cloud infrastructure. Now, supported only Cassandra with AWS EC2
* automated benchmark the databases with various workload distributions like hotspot, zipfian...
 
With CSDE, you can concentrate on your work with the databases, not dealing with setup and configuration. CSDE automates it already for you.
However, like any software on the earth, written by human, there may be bugs and issues. Therefore, please read the description below carefully.

CSDE was formerly known as KCSD(B) and has now changed its name.

 $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
 $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
